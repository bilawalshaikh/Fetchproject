Feedbacks for fetch API project

1. Instead of using input event listeners, see if we can use an event attribute on the button to execute respective function

2. I see a few indentation gaps in HTML tags and CSS file

3. Replace async await with pure promise syntax of .then() to handle fetch API callback function

4. We can skip try catch block, and handle for any exception using promises syntax. You need to check how to do that

5. We can use destructuring to pick required values from response and then use them to output data

6. function declare ya define karna ho tou hamesha usko conditional block ke bahar rakhte hain. You can execute them in the conditional block, but don't create a new function inside such code block
